1. **One command to get started** - Type `npm start` to start development in your default browser.
2. **Rapid feedback** - Each time you hit save, changes hot reload and linting and automated tests run.
3. **One command line to check** - All feedback is displayed on a single command line.
4. **No more JavaScript fatigue** - Slingshot uses [the most popular and powerful libraries](#technologies) for working with React.
5. **Working example app** - The included example app shows how this all works together.
6. **Automated production build** - Type `npm run build` to do all this:

# Get Started

1. **Initial Machine Setup**

    First time running the starter kit? Then complete the [Initial Machine Setup](#initial-machine-setup).

2. **Clone the project**

    `git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot.git`.

3. **Run the setup script**

    `npm run setup`

4. **Run the example app**

    `npm start -s`

    This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
